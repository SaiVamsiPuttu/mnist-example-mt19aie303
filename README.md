Plotting Model performance for different values of Gamma Value

<br/>
SVM algorithm is trained on MNIST data with an image size of 8*8 and with different values of Gamma [0.001,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,10,100]

<h1>Inference:</h1>

From the data in the above table it is evident that model fails to perform well when 'gamma' parameter is increased
