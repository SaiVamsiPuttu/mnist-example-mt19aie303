# Work done on Lab 18th Sep

Tasks performed:

1. Model is trained not more than once on the same gamma value.
2. Threw away some of the models that yield random-like performance.
3. Saved and retrieved models from hard disk, instead of keeping everything in memory.
4. Modularized the code to have following functions: preprocess, train, create_splits, validate, test, report
5. bonus: removed all the hardcoded values from the py file, and made them as arguments
