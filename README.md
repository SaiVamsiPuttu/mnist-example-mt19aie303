# Assignment 11 Submission
# Tasks performed
# 1. Create 80:10:10 train:dev:test split of the data.
# 2. Create smaller training sets that use 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100% of the full training set.
# 3. For each of the smaller training sets, train the model (including hyper parameter tuning) and test of the same test set that was created in step 1.
# 4. Report the line chart that has on x-axis the percentage of training and y-axis test set macro f1.

5. Make some observations about the chart and write.

6. Compare the actual predictions on test set using the model trained with  20% training data vs 10% training data, and 30% vs 20% so-on. Find out what will be good metric for comparing predictions of two models and use that for comparison. Note: don't just say "it has higher accuracy" -- that is aggregate metric comparison. What we are after is a "guarantee that is the model trained with larger data likely to be as good or better on each instance?" Hint: Confusion metrics.
